# Visualization of Earthquake map in relation to the Tectonic plates 
## Overview of the Project
The objective of this project is to visualize the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth. This visualization facilitates three base layers ‘street’, ‘satellite’ and ‘dark’ along with the options of displaying tectonic plates and with major earthquakes with magnitudes of greater than 4.5.
